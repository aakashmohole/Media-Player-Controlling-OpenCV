# Media Player Controlling Using Hand Gesture - OpenCV [Project 04] 

This project enables media player control using hand gestures through the OpenCV library. Users can interact with a media player by performing specific gestures in front of a camera, which is then interpreted by the program to trigger corresponding actions such as play, pause, volume control, etc.

## Introduction 🏆
This project leverages computer vision techniques using OpenCV to capture and process real-time video input from a camera. The program detects hand gestures and translates them into commands to control a media player. The goal is to provide an intuitive and hands-free way to interact with media playback.

## Features 🏆
- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Support for basic media player controls (play, pause, volume control, etc.)
- Easy integration with popular media players
- Minimal dependencies
- Configurable gesture recognition

## Requirements 🏆
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Media player software (e.g., VLC, Windows Media Player)

## Installation 👨‍💻
Firstly, install all the Dependencies using the below command.

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can directly run the ``` main.py ```
script

``` bash
python main.py
```

# Setting Up ✈️

Clone or Download this repository and store it on your machine.


``` bash
git clone https://github.com/aakashmohole/Media-Player-Controlling-OpenCV.git
```

## Gesture Commands 🖐️

The following are some example gestures recognized by the system:

- __Play/Pause__ : Move your hand in the Square area to play and pause.
- __Volume Up/Down__ : Raise 3 fingers in square to Volume Up and 4 fingers to Volume Down.
